Usage: 
ruby get_sql_for_station_inserts.rb all_stations.txt 

Intended to generate sql for inserting latitude/longitude of airports into a table. 

Requires internet connection to function. 

Tests require internet and filesystem access

# Alternate approach idea: curl for an airport if the file does not exist. 
# Separate command to get sql from already-curled airports. 
# Because a single run does not get all data in a reasonable amount of time. 

# Rewrite this in Java for reusability with the team.
